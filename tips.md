# Tips

Some tips on not so common commands you may forget and are handy.

- Check defined mappings and files that set them

```
:verbose map
```

But better use Telescope with `<leader>sk` (search keymaps).

Also, I haven't mapped all Telescope functionality, just a tiny part. Use
```
:Telescope
```

to see the full list of utilities.

- Other usage possibilities

```
:verbose function
:verb abbr
:verb set
...
```
