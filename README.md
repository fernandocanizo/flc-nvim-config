# Neovim from (almost) scratch

This is a Neovim reconfiguration, meaning I'm dropping years of configurations
I've been carrying around. I'll be using
[nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), to have
a sane and cute starting point.

I'm following TJ Devries' video [Effective Neovim: Instant
IDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stqUbv-5u2s)
